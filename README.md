### Project Title
An application to display and analyse Bikeshare data for the US
cities of Chicago, New York City and Washington

### Description
This application will display and analyse Bikeshare data for the US
cities of Chicago, New York City and Washington.

The data was supplied in comma separated value files (.csv)
format, with the first row containing column names.

There are two parts to the app:

1. this part allows the user to print to console a full 'pandas'
dataframe dataset, or just a part of the data, according to the user's
choice of city, columns & rows.

2. this part allows the user to run various statistical analysis on
their chosen city dataset.

'Pandas' needs to be installed for the application to run.

Optionally,'Colorama' and 'Rich' should also be installed to enhance the
visual experience. The application will check for and install these
modules if any are found missing.
